  @moduledoc """
  T-Maze environment for testing memory and learning capabilities of neural networks.
  
  The T-Maze is a classic reinforcement learning task that tests an agent's ability
  to remember previous inputs and make decisions based on that memory.
  
  In this implementation:
  1. The agent starts at the bottom of the T
  2. A cue signal is presented at the start indicating which arm has the reward
  3. The agent moves through the maze and must remember the cue to make the correct choice
  4. Reward is given only if the agent chooses the correct arm
